# Test App

This is a demo application for WILL Billingsley.

#### Some notes:
  - The SERVER was developed using NODE JS (I can do this using .NET Core but I should need more time because I know the language but I'm not an expert )
  - The client was made using ANGULAR. I work with React too but as I have years working with Angular (and I think it's more powerful), I prefer to show this demo using Angular
  - JSON: I could not see any data model for Authors (sorry if it was there and I couldn't find it) so my Author model is just the ID and "name"

### Install and run the server

  - Make sure you have NODE 10+ installed
  - Clone the entire project
  - Go where the file "package.json" is located and run "npm i" to install all the dependencies.
  - Move to folder "server"
  - Run the following command: "node server.js"

### Install and run the client

  - Make sure you have ANGULAR CLI installed (https://angular.io/)
  - Move to the folder "client/angular"
  - Run "npm i" to download all dependencies 
  - Run "ng server" to start the client. Open Chrome or similar and navigate to: http://localhost:4200 to start
